# ABSTRACT
There is no reason why a vital event in the educational sector, such as attendance, should be done in the old boring traditional method in this day of rapidly rising innovative technologies.
For both students and class teachers, an attendance monitoring system will save a significant amount of time and energy.
For both students and class teachers, an attendance monitoring system will save a significant amount of time and energy.
The face recognition algorithm will keep track of attendance by separating the students faces from the rest of the items and labelling them as present. The system will be pre-loaded with photographs of all of the students, and the algorithm will use this data to recognise those who are present and match their features to previously saved images of them.
# INTRODUCTION
The goal of the face recognition attendance monitoring system is to simplify the attendance procedure, which takes a lot of time and effort. It is a convenient and simple method for students and teachers. The technology will take pictures of the children and use a face recognition algorithm to fill out the attendance form. This method, the class teacher's attendance will be recorded without having to spend time on traditional attendance recording.
One of the usual security operations is the identification process to determine the presence of a person in a room or place. Every person who enters a room or building must first go through a series of authentication procedures, so that these details can later be utilised to monitor every single activity in the room for security purposes. The authentication method for detecting the presence of a person in a room or building is still in flux. The procedure differs depending on whether a name and signature are written in the attendance list, an identity card is used, or biometric authentication technologies such as a fingerprint or face scanner are used.
